Thank you for looking through my code!

atmosphere_random -- random number generation
randBMP.py -- image generation
        run using python2 randBMP.py

randBMP_plt.py -- image generation using pyplot and numpy
        run using python2 randBMP_plt.py

All of the random number generation is functional and can be accessed
through the file atmosphere_random. (ie from atmosphere_random import random_ints)

The image was a challenge as I had to learn a new file encoding so has not been tested.
Writing in  the correct file format should be quick to finish.
